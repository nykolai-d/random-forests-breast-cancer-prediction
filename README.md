# random-forests-breast-cancer-prediction
This code builds a Random Forest Classifier using the Scikit-Learn library.<br>

This is a supervised Machine learning algorithm. It creates a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set, based on which it will reach a final prediction.<br>

We use the  <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29">Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set</a> to train and test the model that classifies whether a tumor with certain characteristics is a malignant or a benign tumor
